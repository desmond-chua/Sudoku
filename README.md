# Sudoku
Java class program to test out the efficiency of various algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles.
The algorithms applied in this test consist of basic brute force algorithm vs pencil and paper with depth first search algorithm.

Clone project and Run over a Java application

Basic Requirements
Java v1.8

The algorithms are tested over 1000 puzzles.
In general, the depth first search algorithm performs better.
